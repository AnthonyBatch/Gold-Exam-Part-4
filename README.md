# APC Power Controller Module
This module communicates with an APC power controller to switch outlets on/off and perform a 10 second reboot. It is used in SIMPL Windows in conjunction with a TCP/IP client.
The module handles the login to the device and takes username and password parameters. Default is usually apc/apc.
